Rogier Kievit is Professor of Developmental Neuroscience at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen and Senior Associate Scientist at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge. He studies the rise and fall of cognitive functions across the lifespan by relating brain function, brain structure and cognition in developing populations using multivariate modeling techniques. Specifically, I use a variety of structural equation models to capture the changing relationship between mind and brain across the lifespan. CV

I’m interested in how cognitive abilities develop across age and specifically in how we can use computational models to understand this development. I see it as a scientist’s duty to expand our common knowledge about the world and its inhabitants. As such, I like to challenge myself in communicating scientific findings to society in an understandable way. When I’m out of office, you can find me at the tennis court or at home cuddling with the sweetest cat in the world.

I'm interested in how complex cognition arises. Specifically, how we solve problems, adapt, and respond to ever-changing demands. This has led me to focus on the domains of fluid reasoning and working memory. Recently, my research has examined how genetics and socioeconomics affect the development of these skills. I use a variety of methods depending on the question at hand, this ranges from observational datasets, RCTs, and causal inference techniques. Here I will be looking to see if it is possible to unravel the influences of global and local structural MR metrics on cognition. In my free time, I love to surf, rock climb, and travel (when possible)!

I am interested in the impact of genetics and the environment on children’s development. In particular, during this PhD, I will study how brain maturation (looking at white matter microstructure and grey matter morphology) underlies the development of cognitive ability in childhood. Before this PhD, I completed my master’s degree in cognitive science in Paris with a major in neuroscience. I also had the opportunity to do a gap year during my master training, visiting several labs abroad to train in neuroimaging analyses. In my spare time, I am the vice president of the French association Fédération Fresco and I am especially engaged in our project to create seven cognitive science forums in France in order to popularize cognitive science.

Also, I am interested in advancing the field of cognitive neuroscience through my research. Within the CODEC study, I am studying cognitive variability in early childhood. Specifically, we aim to measure, model, and mechanistically understand the nature of cognitive variability differences within and between children. We will use the temporal precision of experience sampling methods, the richness of a cohort study, and the prospective and developmental power of accelerated 
longitudinal designs. Together this will hopefully provide new insight into the construct of cognitive variability. In my free time, I love to run, lift weights, play and watch tennis, read novels, or search for unique vintage items.

I’m a PhD student at the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI) at Radboud University, and an external member of the Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics Lab. I’m conducting a 5-wave longitudinal study, called the Radboud Early Academic Development Inquiry (the READI project, in short). In this project, we investigate children’s early cognitive, literacy and numeracy development throughout the earliest years of primary school. Specifically, I’m interested in learning more about the cognitive and home-related factors that are associated with individual differences in children’s reading and math development across early primary school. Next to this project, I’m also working on a project featuring diffusion-weighted MRI data, where we aim to investigate the relationships between cortical white matter, executive skills and early reading and math abilities in a large, atypical youth sample.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Medical Biology at Radboud University, with a specialization in Neurobiology. My main research interest lies in the relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders—particularly depression—and cognitive processes. My current research project at LCD explores how mood variability correlates with cognition, and which specific cognitive domains are most affected. The idea behind this is to understand whether standard cognitive assessments accurately reflect abilities when mood states vary. For example, is it appropriate to test individuals on cognitive tasks when their mood may significantly impact their performance and potentially skew the results? I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Pharmacology, Immunology, and Physiology. In the future, I hope to integrate my background in neuroscience and pharmacology to better understand how pharmacological interventions might target cognitive deficits associated with mood disorders. Aside from my studies, in my free time I like to travel and try new foods!
