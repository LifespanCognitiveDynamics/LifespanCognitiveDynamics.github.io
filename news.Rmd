## National Research Software day 2024 

23rd April:

Rogier gave a keynote at the National Research Software day in Hilversum. He highlighted the untenable tension between how important Open Source Software is on the one hand with how fragile, in terms of funding and staffing, it is on the other. 

A recap of the National Research Software day 2024 can be found [here!](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/news/national-research-software-day-recap/)

## Merging of the labs

20/04/2023

The LCD lab and Professor Anne-Laura van Harmelen's Center for the Integration of Resilience Complexity Leiden
(https://www.circlenl.com/) joined forces to share ongoing research and discuss potential opportunities for future collaborations between our groups.

## Successful Lab retreat!

13/04/2023

With so many new group members and projects getting started, the lab retreat could not have come at a better time. Our exalted leader, Rogier, shared the history of the lab and his vision moving forward. Importantly, the day made space for us to collectively help shape the future of the group - not only in terms of the research agenda, but the research culture we wanted to be part of. 

A highlight of the day was presentation roulette, we each prepared 3-4 slides on a random talk and another person presented them without seeing them first. Topic highlights included: why I'm the best bridge builder, violent crustaceans, and just how much is the average Dutch person made of sugar?

## New lab preprints using the ABCD sample

12/03/2023 
Two new lab preprints, both on the ABCD sample. Lea Michel examines the complementary prediction of grey and white matter, as well as distinct metrics within each in predicting cognitive performance https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.529634v1.article-metrics
Sam Parsons uses novel tools of reliability decomposition to show differences in longitudinal stability/reliability across brain regions, structural measures (cortical thickness in particular), scanner types and ABCD testing sites.
