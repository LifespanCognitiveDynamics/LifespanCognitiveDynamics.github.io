## Talk in Paris

21st of March:

Paris workshop on Human Trajectories

Rogier was invited to speak in Paris at an exciting workshop organized by [LaPsyDÉ](https://www.lapsyde.com) on neurodevelopmental trajectories. It was a chance to share our own work on [brain maturation](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053-8119(22)00623-1) and cognitive variability, but also to hear about innovations on disease progression, learning rates, adaptive educational platforms. We got a tour of the amazing LaPsyDÉ institute (former home of Binet and Piaget), whose offices have some of the best views of Paris. We also  did a bit of sightseeing and baguette eating of course.

## BDD workshop ‘Integrating patients and other stakeholders into our science’.

17th of January 2025:

As part of the Research Programme [‘The Brain Across Development In Health and Disease’](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/research-programs/the-brain-across-development-in-health-and-disease), Janita Bralten and Rogier organized a workshop on ‘Integrating patients and other stakeholders into our science’. We heard from Martine Hoogman, Janneke Zinkstok, Wouter Staal and Jelle van Gurp about how to best engage patients, families, patient organizations and many stakeholders, to ensure not only the highest quality science, but that our findings have impact where it is needed most.

## In person launch of REMAC

16th of December 2024:

We had our first in person REMAC meeting in Huize Heyendael. The [REMAC centre](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute/research/di-funded-research-projects/research-projects/remac-radboud-ecological-momentary-assessment-center), founded by Rogier and [Janna Vrijsen](https://www.radboudumc.nl/personen/janna-vrijsen) and supported by Aran van Hout, brings together people from across campus to share ideas, methods, best practices and challenges in experience sampling and Ecological Momentary data Analysis work. It was really exciting to see new collaborations be initiated, and (e.g.) PhD students finding others with similar challenges. Our next meeting will be in March 2025.

## Urai lab shared meeting

28th of November 2024:

We had a shared labmeeting with the [COCOSYS lab](https://anneurai.net) led by Anne Urai. As often happens, there were many areas of overlap and synergy between our interests. For instance, check out [Anne’s new paper](https://osf.io/xk6gm_v1/) on understanding structure in the noise of human performance. Beyond pure science, we also discussed our mutual passion for being a climate responsible scientist and lab, and what we can do to improve the future of the planet.

## Data collection in CODEC starts!

18th of November 2024:

After years and months of grants, ethics approval, piloting and task development, we have finally started data collection in CODEC! We are going into the classroom with our tablets to measure cognitive performance three times a day for 5 days. So far, the children are enjoying the tasks, and we can see the data coming in.

## Codec protocol paper published & variability in anthropoids

1st of September 2024: 

We have published the [protocol paper](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-01904-5) for our ERC funded CODEC study. In the paper, a true group effort, we describe the design, tasks and background of the study. More importantly, we specify a series of directional hypotheses we will be testing as the study progresses. In the meantime, if you’re interested in reading more about cognitive variability, we’ve published a [collaborative paper](https://www.cell.com/callback?red_uri=%2Ftrends%2Fcognitive-sciences%2Ffulltext%2FS1364-6613%2824%2900287-0&code=lys5-KAkLxFd2gru-IFbUiIVzWDdGQaH4Pp2BiMN&state=15634851811) with Farshad Mansouri and Mark Buckley exploring the neural underpinning of response time variability in anthropoids.

## Successful Lab retreat!

13/04/2023

With so many new group members and projects getting started, the lab retreat could not have come at a better time. Our exalted leader, Rogier, shared the history of the lab and his vision moving forward. Importantly, the day made space for us to collectively help shape the future of the group - not only in terms of the research agenda, but the research culture we wanted to be part of. 

A highlight of the day was presentation roulette, we each prepared 3-4 slides on a random talk and another person presented them without seeing them first. Topic highlights included: why I'm the best bridge builder, violent crustaceans, and just how much is the average Dutch person made of sugar?
